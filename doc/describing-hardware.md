# Describe Hardware with Hardware Describing Language

It is pretty much same as describing the procedure of connecting / wielding electronic components or circuit elements together.

First, you need to list all components in the device to be described. It is just like you pour the tiny pieces out from the box you bought from Element14 and enumerate them.

Then you begin to describe how to connect them together. This step is basically same as wiring those components together physically, or at least as drawing the schematic.
